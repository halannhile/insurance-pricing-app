## Features

The tool supports two types of insurance policies:

1. Single life
2. Joint life

Within each group, you can first specify the policyholder age and their group (only applicable to single life products). Under each type of policy, you can choose between:

1. Annuity

The tool will then display the gross premium amount, as well as an evolution plot for the prospective reserves, for which you can choose to compare the reserves against the remaining group (only applicable to single life products).
